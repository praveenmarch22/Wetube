 • Wetube fetches the videos data from youtube’s API.
 • The whole app uses Redux Toolkit for the better State Management of the application.
 • Have implemented Optimized Search Functionality exactly like youtube. Have used debouncing over
  there.
 • And this application has N levels of comments. And it uses react-router-dom for smooth routing and
  developed live-chat that uses API polling.
 • Have used webpack as bundler and have deployed in vercel.
